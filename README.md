# London-Met---Final-Year-Project---TensorFlow

This repository aims to house the Final Year project created by student "Jamie Hoang".

The goal of the project was to utilize Machine Learning to detect steganography within suspected files. 

An addtional tool was created to standardize and format files into sample data to feed into the program to create a model to base its predictions.

    -  The tool that is in reference is "[JH]CW Project - SampleCreator.py"

The actual program itself is housed in a Jupyter notebook which can be viewable on Google Colaboratory

    -  The program that is in reference is "CW_Final_Project_Jamie_Hoang.ipynb"

Documentation relating to the project is available in the links provided below or in pdf files within the repository. Which range from technical breakdowns, research, personal thoughts and evaluation of the project overall.

The project overall is viewed as a success by the assessors. Contributing to the attainment of a First Class Honors. 

## Status and Future Plans

15/09/2022 - Currently there are no plans for iteration or improvements on this project. As the student wishes to focus their efforts on smaller scale project that aim to stretch the student's skills in programming whlist not requiring addtional resources that could impede the student's growth. 

There may be future plans to revisit this project to convert the program into a compiled executable for use on a personal system.
